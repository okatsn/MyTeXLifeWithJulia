# Hello
Clone your work in this folder to exploit the MyTexLife environment.
Everything in the *projects* will be git-ignored; that is, they are not under the version control of the MyTexLife repository.
You should have .git in all repos in *projects* set up; otherwise, changes will be lost after your host machine gone.


For example
```bash
cd projects
clone https://github.com/okatsn/MyArticle.git
```




> ðŸ’¡: If you mess things up, you may try in windows command window `config --default-user root` to make the default user of WSL a superuser; remember to switch the default user back after cleaning is done.
